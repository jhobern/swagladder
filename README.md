swagladder
----------

swagladder is a free software web app for managing competitive ladders with
ELO rankings and matchmaking.

It is written in Rust because it's my favourite language at the moment.

It is called swagladder because it's a unique name and swag is fun to say.

swagladder is licensed GPLv3 (see LICENSE) - you can use it and change it
and all that good stuff but you must release your changes to the world.
